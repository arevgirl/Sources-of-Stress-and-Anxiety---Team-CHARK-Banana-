# Defining Stress and Anxiety

_By Abigail Elcock_

In order to analyze the impacts of mental health on UVU students in a post-pandemic, digital classroom world, understanding mental health and its causes is critical. The uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 global shutdowns has increased anxiety. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “[Public health actions, such as social distancing, are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but they can make us feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety.](https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/stress-coping/cope-with-stress/index.html)” Therefore, the most relevant mental health experience to understand in present society is anxiety and stress. 

Stress is generally defined as a reaction to pressure or a threat. Anxiety is a common, chronic mental health disorder with the ability to disrupt normal function in a person’s life.

Even though stress and anxiety are diagnostically different, they may be difficult to distinguish. To compare and contrast effectively, stress and anxiety will be analyzed via their internal vs external aspects, their triggers, and their symptoms.

## 1. Internal vs External

Stress is most commonly caused by external factors. When something unexpected occurs, the fight or flight response is instigated. This happens because “[[s]tress... [is] a natural part of the fight or flight response and the body’s reaction to danger. The purpose of this response is to ensure a person is alert, focused, and ready to deal with a threat.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stress-vs-anxiety)” Once the external source of stress is removed, the stress goes away. Even when stress lasts for an extended period of time, the stress will subsides once that source is removed.

Anxiety is usually internal and will be continually experienced even when triggers are no longer present. “[Anxiety is typically characterized by a ‘persistent feeling of apprehension or dread’ in situations that are not actually threatening. Unlike stress, anxiety persists even after a concern has passed.](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/external/2018/06/stress-vs-anxiety/)” This persistent, extended dread can be crippling, making anxiety much more difficult to resolve.

## 2. Triggers

Changes in one's environment or everyday responsibilities are often the root causes of stress. The level of stress experienced is proportional to the trigger's severity. Additionally, stress has the ability to build on top of itself. Therefore, the stress people experience is often a compilation of pressure from various triggers of different severity levels. This layered complexity makes stress relief an important practice for everyone to develop.

While stress is proportional to the trigger, "[[a]nxiety [...] is longer lasting and can sometimes seem as if nothing is triggering it; often the feelings of fear or worry are disproportional to the actuality of the event or concern.](https://www.verywellhealth.com/stress-vs-anxiety-5194726)" Anxiety can either be triggered by an existing disorder or by prolonged stress. As such, anxiety triggers vary from person to person. Changes in lifestyle—such as a disruption of sleep patterns or a large intake of caffeine—can be anxiety-inducing. Other common sources of anxiety might include finances, public speaking, conflict, genetic predispositions, and more.

## 3. Symptoms

While stress and anxiety are mental and emotional experiences, they impact us physically as well. Below is a comprehensive list of some of the most common stress and anxiety symptoms.

Physiological stress responses are initiated by the fight or flight response. This response is evident in symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, rashes, sweaty palms, weakened immune system, feeling overwhelmed, and much more. Contrarily, anxiety symptoms are characterized by feeling out of control. Some of these symptoms include restlessness, an unexplainable sense of doom, tingling, numbness, an inability to control thoughts, and so on. Stress and anxiety share some common symptoms: rapid breathing, diarrhea, and constipation. Understanding the symptoms of stress and anxiety may help individuals better recognize what they are experiencing.

## When to Seek Professional Help

At times, reaching out for professional help may be necessary. If stress or anxiety begin impacting daily functioning—mentally, emotionally, physically, relationally, socially, or otherwise—professional help can make all of the difference.

A variety of resources are available to individuals suffering from stress and anxiety. Underlying physical ailments or illnesses can add to stress and anxiety levels. In those cases, traditional medical care may be exactly what the patient needs. Some medical treatments are designed specifically for stress and anxiety. Therapy is also available. According to Bridges to Recovery, "[one of the best things therapy can do for you, whether or not you get diagnosed with an actual mental illness, is give you the tools you need to practice good mental health.](https://www.bridgestorecovery.com/blog/5-ways-to-tell-the-difference-between-stress-and-anxiety-when-to-get-help/)" These tools may include coping strategies, recognition of behavioral patterns, and improved thought processes. 

## Living With Stress and Anxiety

Everyone experiences stress and anxiety, making understanding them vitally important, especially considering the impacts of COVID-19. Understanding what stress and anxiety are will be critical for our analysis and suggestions throughout the remainder of this document.

# Research Sub-area: Potential Sources of Stress for College Students

_By Hunter Osmun_

The average student experiences many stressors caused by themselves and by their environment. Their life is stressful as it is ever-changing and, because of this, college will by nature be stressful (Brougham et al. 2009).

Attempts to categorize this stress have split them into several types of categories. Bulo (Bulo et al. 2014) chose to split them into intrapersonal, interpersonal, academic, and environmental stressors while ACO (ACO) split them based on time, anticipation, situational, and encounter stressors. Depending on the source, stress may or may not be avoidable.

Internal/intrapersonal stress comes from inside an individual. This includes negative thoughts and unrealistic expectations they have of themselves. External stress is a broad categorization for any stress coming from outside a person’s own mind. This includes interpersonal, environmental, and academic stress. Many stresses are, or include, both internal and external elements, such as feeling peer pressure while experiencing mental illness.

For the average student’s overall stress level, academic stress is an enormous factor. This stress can come from family, parents, children, spouses, and many other sources. Academic self-expectations can be realistic or unrealistic, either way increasing stress. Paying for one’s education costs enormous amounts in today's economy (The Haven at College 2019).

The experiences and stresses that students face are never the same. The differences in cultural norms and expectations can cause confusion and frustration. Being a less “traditional” student often means that a student needs to deal with challenges that aren’t generally considered for their demographic. These can include stress from having children, new dynamics of a fresh marriage, or needing to work to pay for their education. Important to note, many of these stressors are in addition to all of the stress that an average student experiences, like getting used to a new dynamic of scheduling. 

On average, around 75 percent of students are moderately stressed during the school year and the remaining 25 percent are split somewhat evenly between high stress and low stress (Pierceall et al. 2007). There are many ways to cope with stress, ways that can be healthy or unhealthy. Healthy coping mechanisms can include therapy, exercise, or talking with friends. Unhealthy coping mechanisms can include alcohol, illegal drugs, and smoking, all of which lead to more stressors, guilt, and shame. Unhealthy coping mechanisms are often addictive, and do more harm than good. However one deals with stress, it does need to be dealt with or else stress will continue to build, making it much more difficult to deal with in the future.

The changes in life that come when an individual becomes a student, one of the largest of which is understanding how to manage their time. This may be a change for students, as many students have yet to need to motivate themselves or to schedule themselves for school, work, and social events. A student's stress will lower when they learn how to manage their time and keep track of their deadlines. Along with the new need to manage time often comes new expectations from roommates. Changes in eating and sleeping habits as well as a lack of time for self-care are all prime examples of what leads to a stressful lifestyle (The Learning Center).

Students need to expect a good deal of change and stress. While sources of stress can be varied, they need to learn how they best relax and cope with stress. It is important to learn healthy coping mechanisms before committing to these life changes.

# Healthy Stress versus Unhealthy Stress


_By Kaitlyn Gudmundsen_

## Introduction

Feeling stress is a part of life. People experience stress from so many things. People in college seem to feel stress quite a bit and it can get very overwhelming if not handled correctly. Not all stress is bad, there is good stress that a person can experience but once stress starts to take over your life it can turn bad quickly. For those in college they can experience good stress when they have a deadline coming up for an assignment. This stress helps to motivate them to get the assignment done. Once the deadlines start piling on though with multiple assignments due in multiple classes it can get overwhelming. Throw on trying to maintain a social life and possibly a job and you can soon start to feel like you are drowning in stress. Let's explore healthy stress versus unhealthy stress and see how we can reduce the unhealthy stress in our lives.

## What is the difference?

This world can be a very stressful place but, stress in small increments can actually be a very good thing to have. A lot of people hear the word stress and they immediately think of it as a bad thing and that is not always the case. There is both healthy and unhealthy stress. According to an article from SummaHealth.org, “[Good stress, or eustress, is the type of stress you feel when you’re excited.](https://www.summahealth.org/flourish/entries/2021/01/stress-management-how-to-tell-the-difference-between-good-and-bad-stress)” This could be a stress you get over an assignment deadline getting closer. This type of stress often leaves you feeling relieved once it passes. Unhealthy stress, or distress, is the type of stress that begins to wear on you, it makes you feel fatigued all the time, you may lose interest in things that used to give you pleasure, and you may even develop physical symptoms. Irritability can also stem from unhealthy stress.

## Is Stress a Bad Thing?

Stress is not necessarily a bad thing as long as you keep it at manageable levels. Stress is actually a necessary and healthy thing to experience in life because it pushes us to stay motivated and on track. A study out of [UC Berkeley](https://news.berkeley.edu/2013/04/16/researchers-find-out-why-some-stress-is-good-for-you/) looked at exactly how acute stress – short-lived, not chronic – primes the brain for improved performance. They studied rats and would give them significant but brief stressful events to see what would happen. From the study they saw that stem cells in the brain proliferated into new nerve cells and improved the rats’ mental performance. Dr. Kaufer, who led the study, said “I think intermittent stressful events are probably what keeps the brain more alert, and you perform better when you are alert.” So stress is not necessarily bad as long as it happens in small doses.

## How Good Stress can Turn Bad

Good stress is the kind of stress people feel when they are excited, the stress you feel when you choose an activity to do or you set goals to feel happy. If you start to experience too much stress it can turn bad because the stress response is triggered either way. If stress is taking over your life then it is bad stress. As mentioned above college students can quickly slip into unhealthy stress when they are trying to maintain their schooling, social life, and a job all at once.

## How to Turn Bad Stress into Good Stress

It is more difficult to turn bad stress back into good stress but it is possible. An article from verywellmind.com, “[Not all forms of bad stress can become good stress, but it is possible to change your perception of some of the stressors in your life.](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-kind-of-stress-is-good-for-you-3145055)” The human body reacts very strongly to a perceived threat, which can create threat-based stress responses. If you change your perception of something from it being a threat to it being a challenge then the fear you may normally feel can turn into excitement or anticipation. The more you practice changing this perception from threats to challenges the more automatic it becomes for you to do and can help you experience good stress instead of bad stress.

## Signs that Stress is Encompassing Your Life

There are some signs to look for to know when a person's overall mental health and well-being are affected due to stress.

* Insomnia or chronic trouble sleeping
* Unable to motivate
* Anxiety resulting in physical symptoms (nail biting, losing hair, losing weight)
* Mood swings (bursting into tears at random times, or easily irritated)
* Depression

If stress gets to be too much it can start to cause health issues like weight gain, high blood pressure, and even heart disease.

## Some Way to Help Reduce Stress

One of the simplest ways to help turn your unhealthy stress back to healthy stress is to try and eliminate stress whereever you can. This may seem weird because a way to reduce stress is to eliminate stress and that is not always easy but if you take a step back and look at things you are doing in your life you can see where there may be things that you do not really need to do.

Relaxation techniques are also a great way to reduce stress. These can be different for every single person but some common ways are meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. It really just needs to be something for you to do that helps you step away and clear your head for a few minutes.

If the stress starts to get too overwhelming you can look for support to help you. This can be by talking to friends or family members about what you are feeling, or if needs be turn to a professional.

Another way to help reduce stress is to go back to the basics of what makes up good health. There are five basic self care steps: good sleep, good nutrition, social support, physical exercise, and belief in something bigger than yourself.

# The Stress of Isolation and the Need for Support

***

_By Cheyenne Ingalls_

Mental health has always been really hard to work through. In all the research that was done the biggest thing that was repeated again and again was support. The most massive problem that was seen during the pandemic was that of isolation making people feel abandoned and unsupported. Or if they were supported they felt they did not want to be a burden for anyone else. As a result that made them feel even more alone and unable to cry out for the help they desperately needed. 

## 1. Isolation and Lack of Support

The biggest problem is that they felt unsupported and isolated, “Based on prior research on isolation and loneliness, children and adolescents are more likely to have high rates of depression, and, probably, anxiety, even after the enforced isolation resulting from the COVID‐19 pandemic ends, according to a study published in the _Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry_. The longer enforced isolation continues, the greater the possibility of an increase in these disorders.” (Knopf) COVID-19 has been awful for everyone involved, however, it has primarily brought to light the true effects that isolation and feelings of being isolated, have on mental health. The community must learn from this and see that isolation is the root for almost every mental illness and as such it is important to develop a more accepting and tight community. COVID-19 was and is an awful scourge on the land, but out of the ashes and pain that it has wrought society can find a better way, a better solution for other problems that are more prevalent now than ever before. 

## 1. Reaching out for Help

People may argue against the idea of getting professional help but the research would suggest otherwise: “Caitrin Gladow, 41, has spent the past few months at home in New Orleans with her husband and three young kids—but she says she's never felt more alone. She says she has zero emotional energy for self-care while juggling work, parenting, "paralyzing" stress, and anxiety and grief from losing people in her community to coronavirus.” (Ducharme) People always assume that they are on their own and can’t reach out for help. Even when they are surrounded by people that doesn’t always mean they feel supported. As a society, it must be changed so that people have more access to the help they so desperately need. To help them feel like they are not alone and can access professional help as their mental needs require. Depression is continuing to increase and yet our ability to access help seems to be declining. We need to find ways to reach out and feel supported.

## 2. Anxiety and Depression -- The Vicious Cycle

With COVID-19 running rampant (even with the vaccine) that can cause excess anxiety. Yes, isolation has caused problems but the fear of catching COVID-19 sometimes supercedes that prior need. “People need consultation with psychiatric experts during a pandemic by not visiting hospitals or health clinics for fear of contracting Covid-19. Based on this, the researchers conducted a study at a mental health counseling clinic in the South Tangerang area, Banten to build an Android-based online mental health consultation service information system, to make it easier for people to consult psychologists or psychiatry experts without creating new clusters.” (Krisnanik, Erly Isnainiyah, Ika Nurlaili, Resdiansyah, Az Zahra Aininda) This creates quite the vicious cycle. The feeling that isolation increases depression, yet leaving the house and risking getting COVID-19 causes anxiety then only increases both depression and anxiety. Anxiety causes us to want to isolate and stay as far away from the perceived danger as possible. Depression makes us also want to isolate and hide until we feel better. Then forcing isolation upon people makes both the depression and anxiety increase ten-fold. 

To recap it is important to recognize it is alright to need support, it is alright to reach out for help, and if leaving your house causes you anxiety? Find other ways to reach out through digital methods. Isolation is incredibly stressful and the best thing you can do for yourself when you are isolated is to reach out for support. We may not be able to interact with others as much as we did before COVID-19, but we can learn that it is a good thing to reach out for support when you feel isolated. Find and seek the support you need.
